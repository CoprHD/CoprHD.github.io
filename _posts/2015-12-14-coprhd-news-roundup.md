---------------------------------------

We had a great response to last weeks [announcements and updates](/blog/2015/12/08/coprhd-release/)!

Many thanks to Keith Lutz, one of our fine colleagues from Intel, for compiling this.

EMC Accelerates Shift to Open Source - CoprHD Community Announces New Release and New Collaborations with Intel and Oregon State University. CoprHD Community Comments:

Bev Crair, Vice President and General Manager, Storage Group, Intel

> "End-user demands for flexible, reliable performance of IT services are driving a shift in the storage industry towards software-defined storage solutions.  The CoprHD Software-Defined Storage controller enables cloud platforms, such as OpenStack, to manage heterogeneous storage. This aligns with Intel's commitment and contributions to the opensource community and our efforts to accelerate development of software-defined storage solutions."

Originally released back in May of this year, the CoprHD Community have announced its first official update with version 2.4: new features, projects, community contributors and a new licensing switch to Apache License, Version 2.0. The new release also adds new support for EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) and EMC XtremIO 4.0. CoprHD is an open source software defined storage controller and API platform that allows for policy-based management and cloud automation of storage resources for block, object and file storage providers.

Additionally, Intel and Oregon State University have joined the CoprHD Community, the former which is heading a project to integrate Keystone with CoprHD. As a result, this will allow Cinder API and/or the CoprHD API to provide block storage services, giving organizations the ability to provide a single storage management interface with CoprHD for their OpenStack services.

The CoprHD Community has developed a southbound Software Development Kit (SDK), specifically designed to make it easier for storage vendors and other third parties to add support for other storage systems to CoprHD. Oregon State University students are developing the first plugin using the SouthBound SDK for a new EMC ScaleIO driver.

Meanwhile the storage automation software CoprHD also received an upgrade and new collaborations with Intel and Oregon State University marking ‘a significant community milestone as CoprHD grows beyond a single-vendor open source project’, EMC says.The CoprHD Community’s first official release includes new feature, projects, community contributors and a new licensing switch to Apache License Version 2.0.EMC says the new release expands the scope of CoprHD to include EMC ECS object storage as well as a new Rest API for EMC XtremIO 4.0 software.

EMC announced an update to an existing complementary open source storage automation project, dubbed CoprHD, which is based on the software that EMC originally created for its ViPR storage controller. Version 2.4 of CoprHD adds support for EMC ECS object storage, as well as a new REST API for the EMC XtremIO 4.0 storage system. As of this week, Intel and Oregon State University have also joined the CoprHD Community as the newest contributors. Intel is leading a project to integrate Keystone with CoprHD, allowing the use of the Cinder API and/or the CoprHD API to provide block storage services in an OpenStack environment. Oregon State, meanwhile, is working on a plugin using a new southbound SDK that the CoprHD community created to integrate EMC ScaleIO storage systems with CoprHD

EMC is fairly new to the open source game. Of course, the company has been involved in open source projects before, but it has never contributed the entire code of a commercial product - a model well-established in enterprise IT - until the release of CoprHD (pronounced ‘copperhead’) earlier this year. Fast-forward eight months, and EMC now has three open source projects, with CoprHD, an open source version of its ViPR storage controller, finally attracting the attention of third-party developers…

Version 2.4 of storage automator CoprHD was improved with help from Intel and Oregon State University. It can now centralise and transform storage from multiple vendors into a simple management platform and interface, EMC claims… Intel and Oregon State University have joined EMC’s CoprHD Community as the newest contributors to the storage vendor’s open source initiative. Intel is leading a project to integrate Keystone with CoprHD, allowing the use of the Cinder API and the CoprHD API to provide block storage services. “We discovered how difficult it was to implement any kind of automation tooling for a mix of storage systems,” said Shayne Huddleston, Director of IT Infrastructure at Oregon State University. “Collaborating with the CoprHD community will allow us avoid vendor lock-in and support our entire infrastructure.”

The CoprHD community has released v2.4 of the technology, which adds support for EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), object storage software, and a REST API for XtremIO 4.0. There are two projects with Intel and Oregon State University for adding third-party storage support and OpenStack integration, which will expand CoprHD from being an EMC-only initiative. CoprHD is available with the Apache 2.0 licence. Check out the community here.
