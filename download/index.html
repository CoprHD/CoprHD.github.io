			<h1>Download CoprHD</h1>

<p>There are a few ways to get CoprHD: download an appliance, use Vagrant, or
	build from source. For beginning users and developers, we recommend you start
	with the OVF or vagrant setup.
	<p>The most recent release of CoprHD is 2.4.

<h2>Download an appliance</h2>
<p>Appliances are brand new - please report issues on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/coprhd" target="_blank">Google Group</a>
	or <a href="https://coprhd.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa" target="_blank">Jira</a>.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://build.coprhd.org/jenkins/userContent/releases/CoprHD-2.4.0.0.4/">CoprHD 2.4 OVF</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://build.coprhd.org/jenkins/userContent/releases/CoprHD-2.4.0.0.4/">CoprHD 2.4 VMDK disk</a></li>
	</ul>

<h2>Vagrant Setup</h2>
<p>Curt Bruns has created an easy to use Vagrant setup which includes ScaleIO for
	for a complete storage stack on a laptop. And if you want to get really fancy, he
	has another branch that includes DevStack.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/curtbruns/coprhd_aio" target="_blank">CoprHD 2.4 + ScaleIO</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/curtbruns/coprhd_aio/tree/devstack-integration" target="_blank">CoprHD 2.4 + ScaleIO + DevStack</a></li>
  </ul>

	<h2>Build from source</h2>
	<p>Recommended for more experienced users. Right now it's only confirmed to work on OpenSuSE,
		although there are reports in the wild of running CoprHD on Ubuntu.
